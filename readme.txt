Sets up the sources of your images so that they are served via the WURFL Image tailor service (WIT) http://web.wurfl.io/#wit.



== Description ==

WURFL Image Tailor (WIT) http://web.wurfl.io/#wit is an automatic image transformation and delivery service, based on ther WURFL device detection library http://web.wurfl.io/#learnmore. WURFL will detect the device, and its screen size and it will resize and optimize the image accordingly. 

This plugin hooks automatically into the WordPress HTML image code generation process and changes the image src attribute so that they are optimized and delivered via the WURFL Image Tailor service. 

It also filters the post contents to replace the images src attribute. But it currently does this for all (!) images that it finds in the post contents.

It does not filter the href attribute of links that point to images in the media gallery (yet).

Make sure you use functions like: 

 - `the_post_thumbnail(...)`
 - `wp_get_attachment_image(...)`

However, do not use `wp_get_attachment_image_src()` because we cannot hook into it (yet)!

Right now we hook into these WordPress filters:

 - wp_get_attachment_image_attributes
 - the_content



== Installation ==

No surprises here:

 1. Install the plugin via the WordPress "Plugins > Add New" admin area or upload it to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory.
 2. Activate the plugin.
 3. It should simply work!
 4. De-activate the plugin to disable it.



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is the WURFL Image Tailor service free? =

So far yes it is, but refer to http://web.wurfl.io/#wit for more info on this. This plugin is in no way affiliated to the service itself. It is a simple connector.

= Is the WURFL Image Tailor service production ready? =

Well, not totally. We have seen it producing 503 errors in some random cases. After all it is a free service (so far).
